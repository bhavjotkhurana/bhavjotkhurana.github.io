        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I work at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and data systems, with projects spanning education
          analytics, experimentation, and database design.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work sits between analysis and implementation: building datasets, designing experiments, modeling
          outcomes, and translating results into practical decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently looking for junior roles in data science, data engineering, and data analytics.
