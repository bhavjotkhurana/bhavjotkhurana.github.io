        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Based in Chicago. Reed College '23 - Mathematics &amp; Statistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and data systems, with projects spanning
          education analytics, experimentation, and database design.
        </p>
        <p><i>Open to junior roles in data science/analytics/engineering.</i></p>
        <p>
          Technical skills: R, SQL (Postgres/MySQL), Python, experimentation design, statistical modeling, dashboard
          reporting, and relational database design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of data work, I spend my time powerlifting, following automotive design, and checking out cool
          places around Chicago for a chill work session. I started
          <a href="https://chicagoworkspots.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chicagoworkspots.com</a>
          to collect work-friendly spots, initially for me and my partner. One simple but important feature is a power
          outlet rating based on the often-overlooked seat-to-outlet ratio. Feel free to check it out and add your
          own suggestions!
